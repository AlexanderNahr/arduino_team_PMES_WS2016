This is a draft for a test case document for black box testing. TCP IP client (e.g. hercules or preferably Android App) is 
required and Wifly module needs to be set up.
Arduino needs to be connected to PC and Arduino Serial monitor should be running to see debug traces.
Send the below strings through the TCP/IP client to the Wifly module and watch the arduino answering. The messages
"Expected return" should be displayed in the TCP/IP client.


Test Case 0: Connect as a client
use TCP/IP client to connect to Wifi with IP 1.2.3.4 and port 2000.

Expected return:
*HELLO*

Test Case 1: Sign in - incorrect
[SIGN_IN%a]

Expected return:
[SIGN_IN_RS%0%0%PW_WRONG]

Test Case 2: Sign in - correct
[SIGN_IN%ilias2017]

Expected return:
[SIGN_IN_RS%0%0%SUCCESSFUL]

Test Case 3: Sign in - keep alive signal
[SIGN_IN%ilias2017]

Expected return:
*HELLO*
NOTE: currently [SIGN_IN_RS%0%0%SUCCESSFUL] is sent back

Test Case 3: Order - correct
[ORDER%ilias2017%6;1;00244;10342;61130;30534;51221;21413]

Expected return
[ORDER_RS%SUCCESSFUL%0%0]

Test Case 4: Order - wrong password 
[ORDER%a%1;2;11111;22222;33333]

Expected return:
ORDER_RS%PW_WRONG%1%27]

Test Case 5:  Log out
[SIGN_OUT]

Expected return:
[SIGN_OUT_SUCCESSFUL]


// below test cases not fully developed

Disconnect module to reset it.
Valid Sign In

Test Case 6: Order - MAXIMUM single order
